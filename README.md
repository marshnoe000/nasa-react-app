# APOD(Astronomy Picture Of the Day) Project
This project uses the NASA api to get a picture and share information about it using a responsive react website. I built this following a tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82PXenL4MGg&t=5268s&ab_channel=Smoljames and added some minor adjustments
